To setup the environment, follow the below steps:

Install Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Install npm by typing "sudo npm install npm -g"

Clone the class from github (git clone https://github.com/brandonnchoii/crush_app.git)
cd into the crush_app directory (cd crush_app)
Type in "npm install" into terminal. This should install the necessary dependencies. 

Type into terminal "node app.js"
If the above step did not work, install the following:
"npm install express"
"npm install body-parser"
"npm install ejs"

Type in "localhost:1337" on any web browser to access the website. If you end your process through terminal, you will not be able to access the website. "node app.js" must be run each time and must be cancelled and restarted for any updates to show. 




Next steps: Create database locally to access the REST stuff that I recently made (open up postgres and create a database and then follow the tutorial Cali posted), but we'll wait on this until AWS is setup so that we can all access the same database.
